# Model Notes


The model is according to the paper _Simple Model of Spiking Neurons_ In this
paper, a simple spiking model is presented that is as biologically plausible
as the Hodgkin-Huxley model, yet as computationally efficient as the
integrate-and-fire model. Known types of neurons correspond to different
values of the parameters a,b,c,d in the model. Figure2RS,IB,CH,FS,LTS have
been simulated by MathSBML.

RS: a=0.02, b=0.2, c=-65, d=8.

IB: a=0.02,b=0.2,c=-55,d=4

CH: a=0.02,b=0.2,c=-50,d=2

FS:a=0.1b=0.2c=-65,d=2

LTS:a=0.02,b=0.25,c=-65,d=2
